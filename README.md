## WordPress Extension for Behat 3

This is a Behat 3.0 Extension for WordPress plugin and theme development.

The Extension allows you to use WordPress functions in your context class if you include `rask\WordPressBehatExtension\Context\WordPressContext` (or create and include a child class of it, i.e. make your `FeatureContext` ).

It also provides [other contexts](docs/Contexts.md).

**Version:** 0.5.0 . *This project follows [SemVer](http://semver.org/)*.

## Installation

*(For 'quick start' guides, please see the [Recipes](docs/Recipes.md)).*

1. Add a composer development requirement for your WordPress theme or plugin:

    ```json
    {
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/stephenharris/WordPressBehatExtension.git"
            }
        ],
        "require-dev" : {
            "stephenharris/wordpress-behat-extension": "~0.3",
            "behat/mink-goutte-driver": "~1.1",
            "behat/mink-selenium2-driver": "~1.3.1",
            "johnpbloch/wordpress": "~4.6.1"
        }
    }
    ```
    You don't *have* to install WordPress via composer. But you shall need a path to a WordPress install below. Additionally you don't *have* to use the Goutte and Selenium2 drivers, but these are the most common.

2. Add the following Behat configuration file below. You will need:

 - The path to your WordPress install (here assumed `vendor/wordpress`, relative to your project's root directory).
 - The database, and database username and password of your WordPress install (here assumed `wordress_test`, `root`, `''`)
 - The URL of your WordPress install (In this example we'll be using php's build in server)
 - A temporary directory to store e-mails that are 'sent'


    ```yml
    default:
      suites:
        default:
          contexts:
            - FeatureContext
            - \rask\WordPressBehatExtension\Context\WordPressContext
            - \rask\WordPressBehatExtension\Context\Plugins\WordPressPluginContext
            # and any other contexts you need, please see the documentation
      extensions:
        rask\WordPressBehatExtension:
          path: '%paths.base%/vendor/wordpress'
          flush_database: false
          install_muplugins: false
          overwrite_config: false
          connection:
            host: 'localhost'
            db: 'wordpress_test'
            username: 'root'
            password: ''
          mail:
            directory: '/tmp/mail'
        Behat\MinkExtension:
          base_url:    'http://localhost:8000'
          goutte: ~
          selenium2: ~
    ```

    *Note the `rask\WordPressBehatExtension\Context\WordPressContext` context included. This will cause WordPress to be loaded, and all its functions available in your context classes.*. You can also include [other contexts](docs/Contexts.md).


3. Install the vendors and initialize behat test suites

    ```bash
    composer update
    # You will need to ensure a WordPress install is available, with database credentials that
    # mach the configuration file above
    vendor/bin/behat --init
    ```

4. Write some Behat features in your project's `features` directory and define any steps. The `WordPressContext` context will make all WordPress functions available in your context classes (but there is a better way).

    ```
    Feature: Manage plugins
        In order to manage plugins
        As an admin
        I need to enable and disable plugins

        Background:
            Given I have a vanilla wordpress installation
                | name          | email                   | username | password |
                | BDD WordPress | your@email.com          | admin    | test     |
            And I am logged in as "admin" with password "test"

        Scenario: Enable the dolly plugin
            Given there are plugins
                | plugin    | status  |
                | hello.php | enabled |
            When I go to "/wp-admin/"
            Then I should see a "#dolly" element

        Scenario: Disable the dolly plugin
            Given there are plugins
                | plugin    | status   |
                | hello.php | disabled |
            When I go to "/wp-admin/"
            Then I should not see a "#dolly" element

    ```

5. Run the tests


 > In our example, since we using PHP's built-in web sever, this will need to be started so that  Behat can access our site.

 > ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t vendor/wordpress -d disable_functions=mail
    ```

    ```bash
    vendor/bin/behat
    ```

## Documentation

Please see the [Docs](docs/Contents.md).

## Aim

The aim of this project is to provide a collection of context classes that allow for easy testing of WordPress' core functionality. Those contexts can then be built upon to test your site/plugin/theme-specific functionality.

## License

WordPressBehatExtension is open source and released under MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more info.

## Health Warning

This is not to be used on a live site. Your database **will** be cleared of all data unless you use a separate database.

Currently this extension also over-rides your `wp-config.php` but this implementation may change in the future.

The extension installs three `mu-plugins` into your install (which it assumes is at `{site-path}/wp-content/mu-plugins`). These plug-ins do the following:

 - `wp-mail.php` - over-rides `wp_mail()` function to store the e-mails locally
 - `wp-install.php` - over-rides `wp_install_defaults()` to prevent any default content being created, with the exception of the 'Uncategorised' category.
 - `move-admin-bar-to-back.php` - a workaround for [#1](https://github.com/stephenharris/WordPressBehatExtension/issues/1) which prevent elements from being hidden from Selenium behind the admin menu bar.
